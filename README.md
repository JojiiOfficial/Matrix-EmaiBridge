# Matrix-EmailBridge
A matrix-bridge written in Go to let you read and write your emails in matrix. You can have multiple emailaccounts in different private rooms and write emails to one or multiple recipients.

<b>Matrix room:</b> <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#jojiiMail:matrix.jojii.de" target="_blank">#jojiiMail:matrix.jojii.de</a>

## Information
This bridge is currently in development. Its not 100% tested
<br>
You can run the install.sh to install it. If that doesn't work, use the steps below and contact me so I can fix it.
<br>

## Install
### Compile method
Clone this repository and run inside the folder
```bash
go get    #fetch the required dependencies
```
and 
```bash
go build -o emailbridge    #compile it
```
Afterwards execute the created binary(`./emailbridge`).<br><br>
-> [Configure](https://github.com/JojiiOfficial/Matrix-EmailBridge#Get-started)

### Docker method
DockerHub: https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/jojii/matrix_email_bridge<br><br>
Run 
```bash
docker pull jojii/matrix_email_bridge
```
to pull the image. Then create a container by running
```bash
docker run -d \
--restart unless-stopped \
-v `pwd`/data:/app/data \
--name email_bridge \
jojii/matrix_email_bridge
```
<br>
This will create and start a new Docker Container and create a new dir called 'data' in the current directory. In this folder data.db, cfg.json and the logs will be stored.<br>

After [configuring the bridge](https://github.com/JojiiOfficial/Matrix-EmailBridge#Get-started) you have to run
```bash
docker start email_bridge  #start the bridge
```
`
Note: 'localhost' as 'matrixserver' (in cfg.json) wouldn't work because of dockers own network. You have to specify the internal IP address of the matrix-synapse server!
`
# Get started
You have to adjust the config file (cfg.json) to make it work with your matrix server.
Invite your bridge into a private room, it will join automatically.
<br>If everything is set up correctly, you can bridge the room by typing <code>!login</code>. Then you just have to follow the instructions. The command <code>!help</code> shows a list with available commands.<br>Creating a new private room with the bot/bridge lets you add a different email account.<br>
Using following command allows you to get an accesstoken for a given user:<br>
```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type:application/json" http://<domain>:8008/_matrix/client/r0/login -d '{"type":"m.login.password","identifier":{"type":"m.id.user","user":"<USERNAME>"},"password":"<PASSWORD>"}'
```



## Note
Note: you should change the permissions of the <code>cfg.json</code> and <code>data.db</code> to <b>640</b> or <b>660</b> because they contain sensitive data, not every user should be able to read them!
